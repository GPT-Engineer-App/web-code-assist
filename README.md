# web-code-assist

Here's a prompt to guide you in building a basic command line version of an AI-powered web application development tool like Devin:

## Objective

Build a command line tool that uses AI to generate code and assist in developing web applications. The tool should take user input through the command line interface and generate relevant code snippets, components, and database queries based on the user's requirements.

## Key Features

1. Command Line Interface: Develop a simple command line interface that accepts user input as natural language commands or prompts.

2. AI Code Generation: Integrate an AI model or use an existing AI API (e.g., GPT-3) to generate code snippets, components, and database queries based on user input.

3. Supported Technologies: Focus on generating code for web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a server-side language like Java or Python.

4. Project Structure Generation: Allow users to specify the desired project structure, and generate the necessary files and directories accordingly.

5. Database Integration: Provide options to generate database schemas and queries based on user requirements.

6. Error Handling and Validation: Implement error handling mechanisms to validate user input and provide meaningful error messages.

7. Documentation and Help: Include a help command that provides information on how to use the tool effectively.

## Implementation Steps

1. Set up the development environment with the necessary programming language (e.g., Java or Python) and libraries.

2. Design the command line interface and define the available commands and their functionalities.

3. Integrate an AI model or API for code generation. Fine-tune the model if necessary.

4. Implement the logic to parse user input and generate appropriate code snippets, components, and database queries based on the input.

5. Develop functions to create project structures, files, and directories based on user specifications.

6. Integrate database connectivity and generate database schemas and queries as required.

7. Implement error handling and validation mechanisms to provide a smooth user experience.

8. Create a help command and documentation to guide users on how to use the tool effectively.

9. Test the tool with various user inputs and scenarios to ensure its functionality and reliability.

10. Iterate and refine the tool based on user feedback and additional requirements.

## Considerations

- Start with a minimal viable product (MVP) and gradually add more features and capabilities.
- Ensure the generated code is clean, efficient, and follows best practices.
- Provide options for users to customize the generated code according to their specific needs.
- Consider security aspects and implement measures to prevent malicious code generation.
- Continuously update and improve the AI model as new technologies and best practices emerge.
